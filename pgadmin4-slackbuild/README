pgAdmin 4
=========

This is the README file for pgadmin4.SlackBuild script.
You use the scripts included here at your OWN risk.

pgAdmin 4 is a rewrite of the popular pgAdmin3 management tool for the
PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org) database. 

This SlackBuild is updated for pgAdmin4 version 6.0 on October 16/2021
This script builds the "Desktop Application" only.

Starting with version 5.0 developers "implemented runtime using NWjs  - Node
Webkit JavaScript - to start pgAdmin4 in a standalone window instead of the
system tray and web browser." quoted from new feature of the release notes.
See the release notes at:
 https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/release_notes.html
 
Using Node Webkit JavaScript brings new risks, new requirements and a lot of
changes to this build script.

Requirements for version 6.0
 *) Nodejs version 12 or later.
 *) Yarn.
 *) PostgreSQL slackware package.
 *) Internet connection.

You also need the source AND nwjs tar ball, get them from the links below.

pgAdmin4 source URL:
https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/pgadmin/pgadmin4/v6.0/source/pgadmin4-6.0.tar.gz

nwjs source URL:
https://dl.nwjs.io/v0.55.0/nwjs-v0.55.0-linux-x64.tar.gz

Build Instructions:

 1) Install required packages. Both Nodejs and Yarn are available from 
    www.slackbuilds.org, I suppose you have postgresql installed already. 

 2) Download pgAdmin4 version 6.0 source AND nwjs version 0.55.0 tar ball
    and place both in the same directory as the build script; URLs are in the info
    file and above.

 3) Build the package with "pgadmin4.SlackBuild". You can find the built
    package in your /tmp directory.
 
 4) Use Slackware package tool (installpkg or upgradepkg) to install or
     or upgrade in your system.

    Note: This new SlackBuild script uses linux build functions provided by the
    developers and included with the source code. PVE is no longer used.
    If you used my earlier build script, then you may remove PVE directory
    from your /usr/local/pve directory.

Enjoy.
