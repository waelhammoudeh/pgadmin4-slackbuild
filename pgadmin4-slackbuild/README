pgAdmin 4
=========

This is the README file for pgadmin4.SlackBuild script.
You use the scripts included here at your OWN risk.

pgAdmin 4 is a rewrite of the popular pgAdmin3 management tool for the
PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org) database. 

This SlackBuild is updated for pgAdmin4 version 6.0 on October 9/2021
This script builds the "Desktop Application" only.

Starting with version 5.0 developers "implemented runtime using NWjs to open
pgAdmin4 in a standalone window instead of the system tray and web browser."
quoted from new feature of the release notes. See the release notes at:
 https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/release_notes.html
 
Using Node Webkit JavaScript brings new risks, new requirements and a lot of
changes to this build script.

Requirements for version 6.0
 *) Nodejs version 12 or later.
 *) Yarn.
 *) PostgreSQL slackware package.
 *) Internet connection.

You also obviously need the source, get it from the link below

https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/pgadmin/pgadmin4/v6.0/source/pgadmin4-6.0.tar.gz

Build Instructions:

 1) Install required packages. Both Nodejs and Yarn are available from 
    www.slackbuilds.org, I suppose you have postgresql installed already. 

 2) Initial Python Virtual Environment with "mk-pve.sh" script provided.
     * Note that I did not remove the prevoius pgadmin4-pve but added
     * two digit number to PVE directory ( pgadmin4-pve60 ).  If you are
     * upgrading from earlier version, you should remove that earlier
     * version PVE directory.

 3) Build the package with "pgadmin4.SlackBuild". You can find the built
    package in your /tmp directory.
 
 4) Use Slackware package tool (installpkg or upgradepkg) to install or
     upgrade built package in your system.

Important Note:

This version (also earlier versions) starts with white blank window!
No user interface is visibale. Resizing the window with the mouse (or hit F10
function key) will make the application UI visibale.
Another way to fix this issue is to change the setting in pgadmin.js file in the
runtime/src/js directory from 'show': false, to 'show': true, implemented in this
script. This has a side effect too. See note in the script.

Enjoy.
