pgAdmin 4
=========

This is the README file for pgadmin4.SlackBuild script.
You use the scripts included here at your OWN risk.

VERSION # 8.2

pgAdmin 4 is a rewrite of the popular pgAdmin3 management tool for the
PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org) database. 

This SlackBuild is updated for pgAdmin4 version 8.2
This script builds the "Desktop Application" only.

Starting with version 5.0 developers "implemented runtime using NWjs  - Node
Webkit JavaScript - to start pgAdmin4 in a standalone window instead of the
system tray and web browser." quoted from new feature of the release notes.
See the release notes at:
 https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/release_notes.html
 
Using Node Webkit JavaScript brings new risks, new requirements and a lot of
changes to this build script.

Requirements for version 8.2
 *) Nodejs version > 12.0
 *) Yarn.
 *) PostgreSQL slackware package.
 *) Internet connection.

Build Instructions:

 1) Install required packages. Both Nodejs and Yarn are available from 
    www.slackbuilds.org, I suppose you have postgresql installed already.

     in the same directory as the build script; URLs are in the info
     file and above.

 3) Build the package with "pgadmin4.SlackBuild". You can find the built
    package in your /tmp directory.
 
 4) Use Slackware package tool (installpkg or upgradepkg) to install or
     or upgrade in your system.


Enjoy.
