pgAdmin 4
=========

This is the README file for pgadmin4.SlackBuild script.
You use the scripts included here at your OWN risk.

pgAdmin 4 is a rewrite of the popular pgAdmin3 management tool for the
PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org) database. 

This SlackBuild is updated for pgAdmin4 version 5.0 on March 14/2021
This script builds the "Desktop Application" only, no server code is
included in the produced package.

In version 5.0 developers "implemented runtime using NWjs to open pgAdmin4 in 
a standalone window instead of the system tray and web browser." quoted from
new feature of the release notes. See the release notes at:
 https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/release_notes.html
 
Using Node Webkit JavaScript brings new risks, new requirements and a lot of
changes to this build script.

Requirements for version 5.0:
 1) Nodejs version 12 or later.
 2) Yarn.
 3) python3 - included in slackware current.
 4) PostgreSQL slackware package.
 5) Internet connection.

Build Instructions:

 1) Install required packages. Both Nodejs and Yarn are available from 
    www.slackbuilds.org, I suppose you have postgresql installed already. 

 2) Initial Python Virtual Environment with "mk-pve.sh" script provided.
     * Note that I did not remove the prevoius pgadmin4-pve but added
     * pgadmin4-pve5.

 3) Build the package with "pgadmin4.SlackBuild". You can find the built
    package in your /tmp directory.
 
 4) Install the package with:
     # installpkg /tmp/pgadmin4-5.0-x86_64-2_wh.tgz
     
    or upgrade the old with:
     # upgradepkg /tmp/pgadmin4-5.0-x86_64-2_wh.tgz
