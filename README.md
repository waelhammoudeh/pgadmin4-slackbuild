pgAdmin 4
=========

pgAdmin4 is a rewrite of the popular pgAdmin3 management tool for the
PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org) database. 

This build script has been updated for pgAdmin4 version 6.7 on 3/29/2022

This is a slackbuild script for building pgAdmin4 package for slackware.
The script was inspired by a thread on Linux Questions Slackware forum
"https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/building-pgadmin-4-in-slackware-current-4175648889"
 
The build script in this repository has been restructured along with the package
file system layout, the package is installed under /opt directory.

The info file "DOWNLOAD" line is NOT confirming to any standard! You may need
to adjust your script - if you use this - or edit the info file.
There are 2 lines with "DOWNLOAD1" and "DOWNLOAD2" prefixes.

I hope somebody will find this script helpful.
