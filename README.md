pgAdmin 4
=========

pgAdmin 4 is a rewrite of the popular pgAdmin3 management tool for the
PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org) database. 

The build script has been updated for pgAdmin4 version 5.6 which uses nodejs.

This is a slackbuild script for building pgAdmin4 package for slackware.
The script was inspired by a thread on Linux Questions Slackware forum
"https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/building-pgadmin-4-in-slackware-current-4175648889"
 
This package uses Python Virtual Environment, a script is included to create
such environment, please see README.PVE file.


I hope somebody will find this script helpful.
